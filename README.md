## Testing 

I tested the website on a number of browsers and devices and all appears to be working as intended.

The responsive design allows for different screen sizes. There was a bug where if the screen became too narrow, the header image would repeat itself vertically but changing the height of the header image div fixed that for all screens above 225px wide.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmadstu.github.io%2FHTMLCSSEPP%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmadstu.github.io%2FHTMLCSSEPP%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Header image repeats itself vertically if screen size is less than 225px wide.

## Deployment
