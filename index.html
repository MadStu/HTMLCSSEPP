            <h2>A brief history</h2>
            <p>The Harley-Davidson MT350s were designed and built from the early to late 1990's.</p>
            <p>Based upon the earlier Armstrong MT500, HD improved the bikes with brake upgrades and electric start.</p>
            <p>The MT350 was designed and built for the British armed forces and came with 2 front mounted panniers and a rear mounted gun box which gives the MT350 it's distinctive look.</p>
